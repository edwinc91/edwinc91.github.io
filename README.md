# edwinc91.github.io
A personal website which links my github, linkedin, and some of my projects.

I used barely any css and no javascript, as I felt my knowledge on the two could be seen on my actual projects.
This, coupled with my thoughts on how my personal website should be straight and to the point with no fluff, is 
why my website is the way it is.

I was heavily influenced by <a href="http://ianenders.com/" target="_blank">Ian Enders'</a> page, as 
I fell in love with his simple design.
